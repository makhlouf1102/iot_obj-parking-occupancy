# Initialize the parking

Go to the folder `parking`:
```
cd parking
```

Then run the file `initialize_parking.py`:
```
python initialize_parking.py
```

Choose the parking places that you want to check up by clicking on the image. When you finish, click on the `q` button to close the window.

If you mis-clicked and don't want to keep this place anymore, you have to close the window with `q` and then redo it from the beginning.

# Alivecode

You have to create an Alivecode Object and link it to a project by clicking [here](https://alivecode.ca/dashboard/iot).

Replace the uth token and the object id in the `config.ini` by the new values of your object.

Run the project:
```
aliot run main
```

# You don't have a good result?

In the file `parking.py`, change the value COUNTVALUE. Change it to the mean of the values shown on the screen. Look at the value in the pink squares.
